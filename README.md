# notreddit
Front end example in React/Redux.

## Dependencies
* Node (v9.2.1)

## Installation
```
git clone
cd notreddit
npm install
```

## Frameworks, libraries and languages used
* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* Lite-server
* SASS

## Supposed ideas
* This is not a connected to a REST API, but soon it should. So I wanted to
contain all non-real code into `src/services/mocks.js` and
`src/services/story.js`

## Run
```
npm run start # this will compile and start a local server
```

## Development
```
npm run dev # this will start a local server
```

```
npm run watch # this will keep compiling the project on changes.
```
